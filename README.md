# 📺 Xtream Web TV

**Live TV Streaming Web App**  
Web application built with Node.js and Bootstrap for streaming live channels from an Xtream Codes playlist.  

- **Project Goal** - The goal of this project is to provide a simple and intuitive interface for browsing bouquets and channels, allowing you to quickly find and play your desired channel.  
- **Requirements** - An Xtream Codes account is required. This application does not provide any streaming sources.  
- **Supported Content** - Only live TV is supported—movies and series are not included.  
- **Responsive Design** - The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.  
- **Customization Options** - Users can customize their experience by:  
  - Selecting which bouquets to display  
  - Enabling or disabling Picons  
- **Electronic Program Guide (EPG)** - An integrated electronic program guide (EPG) is available, allowing users to see upcoming programs and schedules.  
- **Player Features** - The project uses **hls.js** as the player, which supports **Picture-in-Picture (PiP)** mode for an enhanced viewing experience.  
- **Note** - Due to browser codec limitations and potential HTTP/HTTPS conflicts, some streams may not be playable.
